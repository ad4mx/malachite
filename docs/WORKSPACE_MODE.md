# Workspace Mode
You'll never have to work(space) another day in your life!

### Workspace Config

```toml
[mode.workspace]

```

Oh, this is awkward. It seems like there *is no* workspace-specific config yet. I'm open to suggestions though!

### For Now...

You can return to [Getting Started](GETTING_STARTED.md), or head directly into [Repository Mode](REPOSITORY_MODE.md) to see where Malachite really shines!
